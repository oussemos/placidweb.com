# SQL style guide

## Overview

You can use this set of guidelines, [fork them][fork] or make your own - the
key here is that you pick a style and stick to it. To suggest changes
or fix bugs please open an [issue][] or [pull request][pull] on GitHub.

These guidelines are designed to be compatible with Joe Celko's [SQL Programming
Style][celko] book to make adoption for teams who have already read that book
easier. This guide is a little more opinionated in some areas and in others a
little more relaxed. It is certainly more succinct where [Celko's book][celko]
contains anecdotes and reasoning behind each rule as thoughtful prose.

It is easy to include this guide in [Markdown format][dl-md] as a part of a
project's code base or reference it here for anyone on the project to freely
readâ€”much harder with a physical book.
